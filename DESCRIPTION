Description: The package aims to extend the functionality of Seurat package for 
    the general biological science community to address a variety of downstream 
    analysis. Specifically, the package aims to address followingbiological 
    question related to single cell sequencing data:
    1) In Silico simulation of cell cytometry based on two cell markers of 
    interest. It is always necessary but tiring to inspect and separate out 
    different cell types within the sc-seq data to perform downstream analysis
    or reclustering. The cell cytometry module is designed to take in a 
    seurat V3.0 object and inspect whether the 2 selected markers could 
    well-separate cell populations into four quadrants. The user can then assign
    cells into four quadrants based on the 2 markers and user-defined threshold
    for the presence of the markers. A quadrant graph for population 
    distribution and a quadrant graph for mapping back to the Seurat UMAP 
    Dimplot can be plotted.The user could easily extract out a specific 
    quandrant of cell to build a new seurat object containing only the desired 
    cells for downstream reclustering/analysis.The pipeline imitates a flow 
    cytometry process to select out the desired cluster of cells for later use 
    based on unique cell markers, and is especially helpful when conducting 
    research on immune cell populations.
    2) Automated Cell Type identification based on reference table. 
    Currently, researchers widely proceed identification of cell type of the 
    sub-populations in clustering results manually using emperical knowledge.
    However, the lack of comprehensive knowlegde the labour related to the 
    process is tedious. The package provided a efficient algorithm for 
    identification of cell types based on a given reference table of cell
    markers available online, and the user can apply a customized marker
    table for the identification
    3) An interactive session for visualizing Control VS Stim DE analysis.
    The DE analysis usually involves the inspection of clustering plot, the 
    table of gene of interests with fold change and statistical significance,
    and Differential expression plots such as violin plot. The package aims to
    resolve the intricacy and inconvenience while inspecting DE data through
    an interactive ShinyApp integrating botn clustering plot, marker genes,
    cell population, and differential expression. 
    4) Extension and Customization module on CellPhoneDB outputs.
    CellPhoneDB is a powerful tool that has gained popularity to inspect 
    intercellular ligand-receptor interaction. However, the online server itself
    does not come with functions to filter out undesired clusters and to plot
    the cell type interaction graph using Cytoscape. The package will provide
    detailed tutorial on building a publishable intercellular interaction graph,
    as well as various plotting functions to aim the understanding of cell-cell
    interactions
